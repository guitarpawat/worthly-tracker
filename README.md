## Why SQLite?
1. Use Dropbox, Google Drive as a free cloud backup.
2. I estimate myself to record with 50 entries/time and 1 time/month. The estimate over my lifetime will be: 
`50 entries * 12 months * 80 years = 48,000 entries`, which can be handled by sqlite without needs of other database system.
